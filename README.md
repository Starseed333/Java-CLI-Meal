# **Java-CLI-Meal**

### **Description**

A command line application that allows users to keep track of the meals they eat throughout the day and the foods they eat with each meal wether it is Breakfast, Lunch or Dinner. The calories, fat, carbohydrates and protein is then recorded along with the description of the food the user typed in their input which is then stored conveniently into a csv file.
